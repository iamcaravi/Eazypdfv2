   Single source of truth for "what file(s) the user is currently working
   with". The Hero uploader, the Quick Action modal, the nav/search/mega-menu
   tool links, and the homepage tool cards all funnel through openTool()
   below rather than passing File objects to each other directly — that's
   the only place a File ever gets bridged into a tool. No tool's own code
   is touched or duplicated; this just drives the exact same #fi input each
   tool already listens on (or, for the Edit PDF workspace, the editor's own
   public EditorCanvas.loadFile() API — see TOOLS.edit below).
   Shape is intentionally generic (currentFiles is always an array) so it
   can later support multi-file workflows, a "recent uploads" list, or
   workflow-chaining (tool A's output becoming tool B's input) without a
   rewrite — just extend .set()/.metadata, callers don't change. */

   static SEO pages already serve these same paths at build time for
   crawlers; this is what makes the *interactive app* itself answer to
   the same path once JS has loaded, and '_redirects' at the repo root
   already tells the production host to serve index.html for any path

   TOOL_ROUTES), this is a REAL navigation to that tool's own .html file
   - not a same-document panel swap with the address bar cosmetically
   rewritten via history.pushState. That distinction is the whole point:
   a pushState-only "navigation" leaves the ORIGINAL document (e.g.
   index.html) running underneath a URL that looks like a different page,
   so opening that exact URL fresh (new tab, bookmark, reload) under any
   server that doesn't specifically rewrite it back to index.html (Live
   Server has no such rewrite; my own dev-server.py and production's
   _redirects do) shows nothing coherent - or, worse, whatever the
   in-memory document happened to be showing at pushState time. A real
   navigation to the tool's own file has no such dependency: it's a
   plain relative link to a file sitting right next to this one, so it
   resolves identically under Live Server, dev-server.py, production, or
   file://, and lands on that file's own fresh script execution (clean
   landing state) every single time, exactly like typing the URL cold.
   Tools with no physical page (About/Donate/Contact - not in
   TOOL_ROUTES) keep the original same-document panel-open behavior,
   since there's no separate file to navigate to.
   @param {boolean} [bridgeFile] - true ONLY for the two actual "continue
     with this file" actions in the app: a Quick Action modal card (the
     modal only exists because the user just handed over a file via the
     homepage hero dropzone) and a result screen's "Continue to..." card
     (the user just finished processing this exact file and picked the
